# Blues Shots on Goal App

A simple scoreboard written in React and TypeScript for tracking shots on goal and goals during a hockey game. The app uses Vite for development and bundling.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs the Vite development server with hot reloading.

## Building

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Previewing

After building, you can preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment & Contributing

The build outputs static files in the `dist` directory. Deploy these files to any static hosting service or integrate them with your preferred deployment pipeline.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with improvements or bug fixes.
